# dotfiles

My dotfiles. For easy clonin'.

The `init` script puts symlinks in all the right places.

# Hi what are you doing here

So a while ago I wrote [a blog post about a tool I wrote called `sd`][post]. At the time, `sd` only existed in my dotfiles, and the post linked here. But since then, I promoted it to its own repository:

https://github.com/ianthehenry/sd

So if you found this repo in your stars, or someone sent you a link to it or something, it's probably because of that. You probably want to go there instead.
